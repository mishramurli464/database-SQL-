# database-SQl

An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a graphical representation used in database design to illustrate the structure of a database. It visually represents the entities, attributes, relationships between entities, and the constraints on those relationships. ER diagrams are a crucial tool for designing and modeling databases and serve to provide a clear and visual representation of how data is organized within a database.

Here are the key components and concepts of an ER diagram:

## Entities: 
Entities are objects or concepts that have data that needs to be stored in the database. In the diagram, entities are represented as rectangles. Each entity typically corresponds to a table in the database.  
Here are some common types of entities:

-->Strong Entity:

A strong entity is an entity that can exist independently, meaning it has attributes that uniquely identify each instance of the entity. In other words, it doesn't rely on other entities to be uniquely identified. For example, "Person" is a strong entity because it can be uniquely identified by attributes like "Social Security Number" or "Employee ID."

-->Weak Entity:

A weak entity is an entity that cannot exist independently and depends on another entity, known as the "owning" or "parent" entity, to be uniquely identified. Weak entities often have a partial key that, when combined with the key of the owning entity, forms a unique identifier. For example, "Dependent" may be a weak entity that depends on the "Employee" entity to be uniquely identified.  

-->Associative Entity:

An associative entity, also known as a junction entity or relationship entity, is used to represent a many-to-many relationship between other entities. It contains attributes that are specific to the relationship itself. For example, in a database modeling students and courses, an "Enrollment" entity could serve as an associative entity that relates students to courses.

## Attributes: 
Attributes are properties or characteristics of entities. These are represented within entities as ovals or ellipses. Attributes are used to describe the data that needs to be stored for each entity.  

-->Simple Attribute:  
A simple attribute is an atomic attribute that cannot be divided any further. It represents a single, indivisible value. For example, the "Name" attribute of a "Person" entity is a simple attribute.

-->Composite Attribute:  
A composite attribute is an attribute that can be divided into smaller, more basic sub-attributes that represent more basic characteristics with independent meanings. For example, an "Address" attribute can be composed of sub-attributes like "Street," "City," "State," and "ZIP Code."

-->Derived Attribute:   
A derived attribute is one whose value is derived from another attribute, often through a mathematical formula or calculation. It does not have a direct value stored in the database but is computed when needed. An example is a "Age" attribute derived from a "Date of Birth" attribute.

-->Multi-valued Attribute:  
A multi-valued attribute can hold multiple values for a single entity. For instance, an "Email" attribute for a "Person" entity may have multiple email addresses.

-->Key Attribute:  
A key attribute is used to uniquely identify instances of an entity within a set. It can be a primary key or a candidate key. For example, an "EmployeeID" attribute is a key attribute for an "Employee" entity.

-->Single-valued Attribute:   
A single-valued attribute can hold only one value for a given entity. Most attributes are single-valued by default.

-->Null Attribute:   
A null attribute is an attribute that can have a null or missing value. It is used when the value may be unknown or not applicable.

-->Stored Attribute:   
A stored attribute is one whose values are permanently stored in the database. Most attributes in a database are stored attributes.  

## Relationships: 
Relationships indicate how entities are related or connected to one another. They are represented as diamond shapes connecting entities. Relationships help define how data is shared between entities.

## Cardinality: 
Cardinality represents the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with the number of instances of another entity in a relationship.

Here's an explanation of cardinality in ER diagrams with diagrams to illustrate: 

### --> One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:

In a one-to-one relationship, each entity on one side is associated with exactly one entity on the other side, and vice versa.
For example, consider a "Person" entity and a "Passport" entity. Each person has only one passport, and each passport belongs to only one person.

### --> One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:  

In a one-to-many relationship, each entity on one side can be associated with one or more entities on the other side, but entities on the other side are associated with only one entity on the first side.
For instance, consider an "Author" entity and a "Book" entity. An author can write multiple books, but each book is authored by only one author.

### --> Many-to-One (N:1) Relationship:

This is essentially the reverse of a one-to-many relationship. Many entities on one side can be associated with only one entity on the other side.
In the "Employee" and "Department" example, each employee works in only one department, but each department can have multiple employees.

### --> Many-to-Many (N:N) Relationship:

In a many-to-many relationship, multiple entities on both sides can be associated with multiple entities on the other side.
Consider a "Student" entity and a "Course" entity. A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.

## Primary Key: 
A primary key is an attribute that uniquely identifies each instance of an entity. In the diagram, primary keys are typically underlined.

## Foreign Key: 
A foreign key is an attribute in one entity that is used to establish a link to another entity. Foreign keys are used to represent relationships between entities.

## Participation: 
Participation indicates whether an entity is mandatory (total participation) or optional (partial participation) in a relationship.  

*Total participation constraint*  
It specifies that each entity present in the entity set must mandatorily participate in at least one relationship instance of that relationship set,for this reason, it is also called as mandatory participation
It is represented using a double line between the entity set and relationship set.  
It means that every student must have enrolled at least in one course.

*Total participation constraint*   
It specifies that each entity in the entity set may or may not participate in the relationship instance of the relationship set, is also called as optional participation.  
A single line between the entities i.e courses and enrolled in a relationship signifies the partial participation,which means there might be some courses where enrollments are not made i.e enrollments are optional in that case

## Degree of relationship  
Here are the most common degrees of relationship:  

*Unary Relationship (Degree 1):* 
In a unary relationship, an entity is related to itself. For example, consider an entity "Employee" and a unary relationship "Supervises," where an employee supervises other employees.

*Binary Relationship*  

Binary Relationship (Degree 2): In a binary relationship, two entities are related to each other. This is the most common type of relationship and is used to represent associations between two different entity types. For example, consider entities "Author" and "Book" with a binary relationship "Writes," where authors write books.

*TernaryRelationship*  

Ternary Relationship (Degree 3): In a ternary relationship, three entities are related to each other. It is less common than binary relationships but is used when a relationship involves three distinct entities. For example, consider entities "Student," "Course," and "Professor" with a ternary relationship "Teaches," where a student enrolls in a course taught by a professor.  

*Higher-Degree Relationships:*  

Higher-Degree Relationships: Relationships can involve more than three entities, resulting in higher-degree relationships. For example, a quaternary relationship involves four entities, and so on. Higher-degree relationships are used when modeling complex scenarios that involve multiple entities interacting with each other.
